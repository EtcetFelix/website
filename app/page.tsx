        I build software, usually around AI. Recently wrapped up Nova Video, a startup where we built personalized video tools for sales outreach. Before that, I built robots and had stints at NASA and other places.

        I&apos;m drawn to early-stage projects where you&apos;re figuring things out as you go. When I&apos;m not building things, I&apos;m playing guitar, practicing Italian, or hanging with my best bud, my dalmatian Balenciaga.
