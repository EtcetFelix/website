        I build software, mostly around AI. Recently wrapped up Nova Video, a startup where we built personalized video tools for sales outreach. Before that, I built robots and had stints at NASA and other places.

        I'm drawn to early-stage projects where you're figuring things out as you go. If you don't find me building things, I'm playing guitar, practicing Italian, exploring history and philosophy, or hanging with my best bud, my dalmatian Balenciaga. I track my calories obsessively and own a protein powder brand on the side.
