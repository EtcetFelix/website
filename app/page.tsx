        I build software, usually around AI. Recently wrapped up Nova Video, a startup where we built personalized video tools for sales outreach. Before that, I built robots and had stints at NASA and other places.

        I'm drawn to early-stage projects where you're figuring things out as you go. When I'm not building things, I'm playing guitar, practicing Italian, or hanging with my best bud, my dalmatian Balenciaga.
